We know that 100 is 2 times 50, so:\n   100 \u00f7 2 = 50\n\n2. Now, we need to divide 50 by 2 again. Since 50 is 2 times 25, we have:\n   50 \u00f7 2 = 25\n\n3. Finally, we divide 25 by 2. Since 25 is 2 times 12 with a remainder of 1, we have:\n   25 \u00f7 2 = 12 with a remainder of 1\n\nSo, 100 divided by 4 is 25 with a remainder of 1.\n\nFinal answer: 25",
