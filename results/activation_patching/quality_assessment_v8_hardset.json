First, we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:\n   4x + 6 - 6 = 38 - 6\n   4x = 32\n\n2. Now we have 4x = 32. To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n   4x \u00f7 4 = 32 \u00f7 4\n   x = 8\n\nSo, x = 8.",

        "text": "Sure, let's solve the equation step by step:\n\n1. Start with the given equation:\n   \\[\n   2x - 5 = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. To isolate the term with \\(x\\), we need to get rid of the \\(-5\\) on the left side. We do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   2x - 5 + 5 = 9 + 5\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   2x = 14\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, to solve for \\(x\\), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2x}{2} = \\frac{14}{2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = 7\n   \\]\n\nSo, the solution is \\(x = 7\\).\n\nFinal answer: \\(x = 7\\).",
