For example, the square root of 9 is 3 because 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n2. **Identify the number we're working with**: In this case, we're looking for the square root of 64.\n\n3. **Consider the properties of square roots**: The square root of a number is always positive. For example, the square root of 4 is 2, not -2.\n\n4. **Estimate the square root**: We know that 8 * 8 = 64, so the square root of 64 must be 8. This is because 8 is the number that, when squared, gives 64.\n\n5. **Verify the calculation**: Let's check if 8 * 8 = 64:\n   - 8 * 8 = 64\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The square root of 64 is 8.\n\nFinal answer: 8",

For example, the square root of 9 is 3 because 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n2. **Identify the number**: We need to find the square root of 49. This means we are looking for a number that, when squared, equals 49.\n\n3. **List the possible square roots**: We know that 7 * 7 = 49, and 3 * 3 = 9. Since 49 is a perfect square, it has two square roots: 7 and -7. However, when we talk about the square root of a positive number, we typically mean the positive root.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The square root of 49 is 7.\n\nFinal answer: 7",

Since 49 is closer to 49 than 36, the square root of 49 must be closer to 7 than to 6.\n\n5. **Calculate the exact square root**: We can use a calculator or long division to find that the square root of 49 is exactly 7.\n\n6. **Verify the result**: We can check that 7 * 7 = 49, confirming that 7 is indeed the square root of 49.\n\nTherefore, the square root of 49 is 7.\n\nFinal answer: 7",
