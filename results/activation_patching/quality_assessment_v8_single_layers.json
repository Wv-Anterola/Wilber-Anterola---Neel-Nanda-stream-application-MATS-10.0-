For example, the square root of 9 is 3 because 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n2. **Identify the number we're working with**: In this case, we're looking for the square root of 64.\n\n3. **Consider the properties of square roots**: The square root of a number is always positive. For example, the square root of 4 is 2, not -2.\n\n4. **Estimate the square root**: We know that 8 * 8 = 64, so the square root of 64 must be 8. This is because 8 is the number that, when squared, gives 64.\n\n5. **Verify the calculation**: Let's check if 8 * 8 = 64:\n   - 8 * 8 = 64\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The square root of 64 is 8.\n\nFinal answer: 8",
